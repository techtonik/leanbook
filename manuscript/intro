# Intro

For many years Python had ability to install modules and packages, and for many years it was impossible to do uninstalls. Now this ability is provided by external tool called `pip`, but why is it needed and what happens behind the scenes?

At the end of this book, you will likely to get familiar with established practice in packaging internals, might get a better understanding what a Python package is,  what types of packages exist, and maybe even how to distribute Python code for various operating systems. 

The book is written in parallel with "researching" problems behind packaging in my free time. If you find this stuff useful, you may support the activity through https://gratipay.com/techtonik/ In future, we may add an ability to add specific targets (goals or causes) to Gratipay so that you can specifically "thank" for the existence particular book.
