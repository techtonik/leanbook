What a **Python source package**?

An informal official definition:

  Python source package is an archive in OS system specific
  archive format (.tar.gz or .zip) produced by
  **setup.py sdist** command.

That definition is not sufficient to understand what
exactly the package contains and how it can be used. The
only thing that is evident is that nothing except `sdist'
command can produce such package.

A more useful non-official definition could be:

  Packed Python sources that can be installed on target
  system and/or compiled into binary package format.

Or alternative:

  Archive with packed pure Python code that can be
  installed by pip from PyPI.

So if the can be installed and contains the full source of
the Python application/module, that is a **source
package**.


### Reversing the Python source distribution format

But what is in the archive exactly? Well, the following
can be uploaded to PyPI and installed using pip as of
April 2015. Thing may break in future if PyPA team
decides to "fix the issue".

 * [x] .zip with setup.py at root (hexdump-3.2.zip)
 * [x] archive with setup.py in a directory named after
   archive
 * [ ] archive with setup.py in arbitrary directory
