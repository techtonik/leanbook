# An important remark about using the `package` word

In general, **a package** is software packed in a special way for some
purpose.  In Python `a package` is just a directory to group multiple Python
modules together under one importable namespace. Such directories have
`__init__.py` file inside to be recognized by Python interpreter as
**importable package**.

Archives with code and binaries are is called **distributions** in Python
world, because historically the name `package` was busy. But people (including
me) are still using the word `package` to refer to such archives, because we
used to this concept from Linux, and because it is convenient. That increases
chances to make any explanations involving both `package` concepts extremely
confusing, so keep note on the **context** where the word `package` is used to
not get lost.

Funny that even in Python word people rarely use the word `distribution` to
refer to packaged archive. Even official distribution site - **PyPI** is an
abbreviation of `the Python Package Index`. I can guess that that's because
Python interpreter itself could be distributed in different ways on different
operating systems.

So, official Python docs are good with definitions, but that's didn't get
viral, and we can't rely that people read the docs these days. This book may
repeat some details from that docs, but adds more details on what's going on
in 2015. Still, to make the concepts more clear, the book tries to follow this
terminology:

  * **Python package**  - directory that Python interpreter can import
  * **package**  - archive
  * **source package**  - archive with Python source code
  * **binary package**  - archive with compiled extensions
  * **extension** - .dll or .pyd module from non-Python sources

There were more attempts to improve packaging and that gave birth to new
package formats called `eggs` and `wheels` (more on them in later chapters).

  * **egg** - package format used by setuptools tools
  * **wheel** - package format to install by unpacking

Both **wheel** and **egg** formats may carry binary stuff.
