# Intro

For many years Python had an ability to install modules and packages
through `setup.py` script, and for many years there was no way to
uninstall. Now external tool called `pip` is able to carry both install
and uninstall operations, but why is it needed and what happens behind
the scenes?

At the end of this book, you will get familiar with established practices
and internals of Python packaging, get a better understanding what a
Python package is, what types of packages exist, and how to distribute
Python code for various operating systems. 

The book is written in parallel with "researching" problems behind
packaging in my free time. If you find this stuff useful, you may support
the activity through https://gratipay.com/techtonik/ In future, Gratipay
will likely get an ability to add specific targets (goals or causes), so
you could specifically "thank" for the existence of this particular book.
